# Calculator Web-App

This is a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations.

## Usage

To use the calculator, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The calculator interface will be displayed, and you can perform calculations by clicking on the buttons or using the keyboard.

## Features

- Input display: The calculator has an input display field where the entered values and the result are shown.
- Clear button: Clicking the "C" button clears the input display.
- Arithmetic operations: You can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using the respective buttons.
- Parentheses: The calculator supports parentheses for grouping expressions.
- Evaluation: Clicking the "=" button evaluates the expression and displays the result in the input display.
- Error handling: If an invalid expression is entered, the calculator displays an error message.

## Styling

The calculator interface is styled using CSS. The `style.css` file contains the styles for the calculator elements, including the background, display, and buttons.

## Scripts

The calculator functionality is implemented using JavaScript. The `script.js` file contains the JavaScript functions that handle appending values, clearing the display, and evaluating the expression.
